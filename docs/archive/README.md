## Why Archive?

Completed proposals and historical documents are archived rather than deleted because they:

1. Document the evolution of the extension
2. Provide context for why certain decisions were made
3. Serve as templates for future proposals
4. Help new contributors understand the development history

For current documentation, see the main `docs/` folder.
