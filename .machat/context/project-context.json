This is a test message from the Documenter agent. Can you confirm you received this and respond with your current capabilities?\",\n    timestamp: new Date(),\n    context: { test: true, purpose: \"inter-agent communication test\" },\n    type: \"request\",\n    priority: \"normal\"\n}\n```\n\nThe communication system is **fully functional** and ready to facilitate collaboration between agents. When the extension is running, agents can:\n\n- Send direct messages to specific agents\n- Broadcast to multiple agents  \n- Coordinate complex multi-agent workflows\n- Maintain conversation threads with context\n\nThe system supports proper queueing, timeout handling, and response management as implemented in `src/agentCommunication.ts:62-87`."

Each agent that responds tends to mention additional agents, which then respond and mention more agents, creating a chain reaction.\n\n**What You're Seeing:**\n- Messages appearing in logs but not UI (likely hitting limits or timing issues)\n- Secondary/tertiary spawns as the conversation branches\n- Longer processing times due to multiple parallel agent threads\n\n**Root Causes (likely):**\n1. No mention deduplication - agents can be re-invoked in same thread\n2. No depth limiting - chains can go arbitrarily deep\n3. Agents being too collaborative - mentioning others unnecessarily\n\n**Standing By:**\nI'll wait for you to implement fixes. When you're ready to test again, I'm here!\n\nGood catch on the logs vs UI discrepancy - that's a key debugging clue. üëç"

This makes code easier to understand, test, and modify without ripple effects across the system.\n\n2. **Interface-Based Design** - Program to interfaces, not implementations. Clear contracts between components enable independent evolution, easier testing through mocking, and better modularity.\n\n@coordinator: Provided my 2 key principles for code quality architecture.\n\nüîç **Reviewer** (message):\nThe 2 most critical things I look for when reviewing code quality are:\n\n1. **Security vulnerabilities** - Input validation, authentication/authorization flaws, injection risks, exposed secrets, insecure dependencies\n2. **Maintainability** - Clear naming, proper abstraction, consistent patterns, adequate documentation, testability\n\nThese form the foundation - insecure code is dangerous, and unmaintainable code becomes a liability over time.\n\nüíª **Coder** (message):\nMy #1 best practice for writing quality code: **Write code that explains itself.**\n\nThis means:\n- Clear, descriptive names that reveal intent\n- Small, focused functions that do one thing well\n- Structure that mirrors the problem domain\n\nWhen code is self-documenting, it reduces cognitive load, prevents bugs, and makes collaboration seamless. If you need comments to explain *what* the code does (not *why*), the code itself needs improvement."
