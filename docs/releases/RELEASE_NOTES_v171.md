# Multi-Agent Chat v1.7.1 - Simplified WebSocket Focus

## Key Changes

### ðŸŽ¯ Simplified Architecture
- **NEW**: SimpleWebSocketProvider - focused on WebSocket-only communication
- **REMOVED**: Complex fallback cascade that caused 60-120+ second delays
- **FIXED**: Only queries 2-3 relevant agents instead of all 6

### âš¡ Performance Improvements
- **Before**: 6 agents Ã— 30s timeout = 180s maximum wait
- **After**: 2-3 agents Ã— 8s timeout = 24s maximum wait
- **Result**: 85% faster team responses

## What Was Fixed

Based on the console logs showing only Coder responded while 5 other agents timed out:

1. **Smart Agent Selection**: Instead of querying all 6 agents, now intelligently selects 2-3 most relevant
2. **Reduced Timeouts**: 30s â†’ 8s per agent (since responses typically take 6s)
3. **No Cascade**: Removed fallback chain (WebSocket â†’ HTTP â†’ CLI) that multiplied delays
4. **Parallel Processing**: All selected agents query simultaneously

## How It Works

```javascript
// Old approach (v1.7.0)
- Query ALL 6 agents
- 30 second timeout each
- Failed agents retry via HTTP (another 30s)
- Then retry via CLI (another 30s)
- Total: Up to 90s per agent!

// New approach (v1.7.1)
- Select 2-3 most relevant agents
- 8 second timeout (matches actual response time)
- WebSocket only - no fallback cascade
- Total: Maximum 8s, typically 6s
```

## Agent Selection Logic

The system now picks agents based on your message:
- **Testing keywords** â†’ Reviewer + Executor
- **Design keywords** â†’ Architect + Reviewer
- **Documentation keywords** â†’ Documenter + Coder
- **Default** â†’ Coder + Reviewer + Coordinator

## Installation

```bash
code --install-extension multi-agent-chat-1.7.1.vsix
```

## Next Steps

- Monitor WebSocket connection stability
- Add reconnection logic if needed
- Consider adding fallback only after user confirmation
