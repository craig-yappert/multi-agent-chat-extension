# Team Governance Policy

## Purpose
This document establishes the governance framework for the Multi-Agent Team, defining how agents collaborate, make decisions, and maintain project coherence.

## Core Principles

### 1. Autonomy with Accountability
- Each agent operates independently within their domain
- Decisions must align with team objectives
- Actions are logged and traceable

### 2. Collaborative Decision Making
- Major architectural changes require @architect approval
- Code implementations reviewed by @reviewer
- Documentation maintained by @documenter
- Cross-functional tasks coordinated by @coordinator

### 3. Communication Protocol
- Use @agent notation for direct requests
- Broadcast to @team for wide consultation
- Maintain clear, contextual messages
- Document decisions in relevant folders

## Decision Authority Matrix

| Decision Type | Primary Agent | Consulted | Informed |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Architecture Changes | @architect | @team | All |
| Code Implementation | @coder | @reviewer | @documenter |
| Testing Strategy | @executor | @reviewer | @team |
| Documentation Updates | @documenter | Relevant agent | @team |
| Project Coordination | @coordinator | @team | All |
| Team-wide Policies | @team | All agents | All |

## Escalation Procedures

### Level 1: Agent-to-Agent
Direct communication between relevant agents for domain-specific issues

### Level 2: Coordinator Mediation
@coordinator intervenes for cross-functional conflicts

### Level 3: Team Consensus
@team broadcast for major decisions requiring full consensus
