# Agent Communication Status Updates

## New Feature: Real-time Communication Status

The extension now provides detailed status updates when agents communicate, giving you visibility into the message flow like a console output.

## What's New

### User-to-Agent Status
When you send a message to an agent, you'll now see:
- `📨 User message sent to [Agent]. [Icon] [Agent] is processing...`

### Agent-to-Agent Status
When agents communicate with each other, you'll see:
- `[Icon] [FromAgent] sending message to [Icon] [ToAgent]...`
- `[Icon] [ToAgent] is processing message from [Icon] [FromAgent]...`

### Visual Indicators

1. **Status Bar**: Shows current activity at the top of the chat
2. **Console Messages**: Status updates appear as system messages in the chat (marked with 🔄)
3. **Agent Icons**: Each status message includes the agent's icon for quick identification

## How It Works

### Architecture
```
User Message
    ↓
Extension sends status: "User sent to Agent"
    ↓
Agent processes (if contains @agent command)
    ↓
AgentCommunicationHub sends status: "Agent1 sending to Agent2"
    ↓
Target Agent processes
    ↓
Hub sends status: "Agent2 processing from Agent1"
    ↓
Response delivered
```

### Status Flow

1. **Initial Send**: When you send a message, immediate feedback shows it was received
2. **Inter-Agent**: When agents communicate, each hop is tracked and displayed
3. **Processing**: Clear indication of which agent is currently working
4. **Completion**: Status bar hides after response is delivered

## Benefits

- **Transparency**: See exactly what's happening during multi-agent collaboration
- **Debugging**: Understand the communication flow between agents
- **Feedback**: No more wondering if your message was received
- **Progress**: Know which agent is currently processing

## Example Flow

```
User: "@architect Can you design a database schema?"
Status: 📨 User message sent to Architect. 🏗️ Architect is processing...

Architect: "I'll design that. @coder: Can you implement the User table?"
Status: 🔄 🏗️ Architect sending message to 💻 Coder...
Status: 🔄 💻 Coder is processing message from 🏗️ Architect...

Coder: "Here's the implementation..."
Status: Response delivered
```

## Configuration

The status messages respect your existing settings:
- `multiAgentChat.agents.showInterCommunication`: Controls visibility of inter-agent messages
- Status updates appear regardless but can be minimized

## Technical Implementation

### Components Updated

1. **AgentCommunicationHub**: Added status callback for real-time updates
2. **Extension.ts**: Sends status messages to webview
3. **Script.ts**: Displays status in both bar and chat
4. **Providers.ts**: Tracks message flow through providers

### Status Types

- `sending`: Agent is sending a message
- `processing`: Agent is processing received message
- `completed`: Message has been processed (status bar hides)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Elapsed time tracking per agent
- Message queue visualization
- Failed message indicators
- Retry status for failed communications
