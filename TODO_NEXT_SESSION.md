# Multi Agent Chat Extension - Next Session Todos

## Recently Completed (This Session) ✅

### Fixed Critical Issues
1. **Agent Tag Persistence**
   - Agent metadata (name, icon, color) now saves with messages
   - Tags properly reload when viewing conversation history
   - Added agent field to ConversationData interface

2. **Agent Memory System**
   - Implemented conversation context per agent
   - Each agent maintains last 10 exchanges (20 messages)
   - Context persists across session saves/loads
   - Added backward compatibility for old conversations

3. **File Operations Support**
   - Executor agent can now create/write files
   - Automatic file creation from agent responses
   - Pattern matching for file operations in responses

4. **Conversation Cleanup**
   - Added command to clear all conversation history
   - Clears workspace state and files
   - Fresh start capability for testing

## Priority Tasks (In Order)

### 1. ~~Inter-Agent Communication~~ ✓ Partially Complete
- Basic framework exists in agentCommunication.ts
- Need to test and refine the implementation
- Add visual indicators when agents are collaborating

### 2. ~~New Chat and History Saving~~ ✓ COMPLETED
- Session management implemented
- Conversation history saves automatically
- Load previous conversations working
- Clear all conversations command added
- Agent context preserved across sessions

### 3. Settings Screen Enhancement
- Create more comprehensive settings UI
- Add inter-agent communication toggles
- Agent-specific model selection controls
- Performance tuning options

### 4. Code Cleanup
- Remove old Claude Chat remnants
- Clean up unused styles from ui-styles.ts
- Remove hidden UI objects that are no longer needed
- Consolidate duplicate code

### 5. Agent Response Streaming
- Real-time streaming already partially implemented
- Need to improve UI updates during streaming
- Add better typing indicators for agents

### 6. Testing & Validation Phase
- Test agent memory across multiple sessions
- Validate file operations with different file types
- Test conversation reload with new agent metadata
- Verify inter-agent communication workflows

### 7. Agent Specialization Refinement
- Fine-tune each agent's role context
- Improve specialized responses
- Add more specific capabilities per agent
- Optimize prompts for better agent differentiation

### 8. Custom Agent Creation
- Allow users to define their own agents
- Custom roles and capabilities
- Agent configuration UI
- Save/load custom agent definitions

### 9. Three-Tier Agent Memory System
- **Short-term memory**: ✓ Implemented (current conversation)
- **Long-term memory**: Cross-session learning needed
- **Project-specific memory**: Isolated contexts per project
  - Prevent context bleeding between projects
  - Project-aware agent responses

### 10. Error Recovery
- Better handling of Claude API failures
- Timeout recovery
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- User-friendly error messages

## Testing Instructions for Next Session

1. **Clear All Conversations First**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Run "Clear All Conversation History"
   - Confirm deletion

2. **Test Agent Memory**
   - Start conversation with Coder agent
   - Ask follow-up questions
   - Switch agents and verify context switches
   - Reload VS Code and verify memory persists

3. **Test File Operations**
   - Ask Executor to create a test file
   - Verify file appears in workspace
   - Check file contents match request

4. **Test Agent Tags**
   - Have conversations with different agents
   - Close and reopen chat
   - Verify agent names/icons display correctly

## Current State (v1.8.0+)

- All agents using Claude Sonnet model
- Agent conversation memory implemented
- File operations working through Executor
- Agent metadata persists across sessions
- Conversation cleanup command available
- Team agent coordinates all 6 specialized agents
- Visual agent identification with colors working
- All agents functional with real Claude backend

## Notes

- Focus on testing the new features thoroughly
- Monitor console for any errors during agent operations
- Check that agent context doesn't grow too large (limited to 20 messages)
- Ensure file operations are safe and controlled
