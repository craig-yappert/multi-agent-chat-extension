## ü§î Open Questions for Community

These are the key questions to ask once released:

1. **Orchestration Model** (Critical decision needed)
   - Should Coordinator be a gateway for all complex requests?
   - Should all agents learn to orchestrate?
   - Should we auto-detect complexity and route accordingly?

2. **Provider Priorities**
   - Which providers do users prefer?
   - Is Copilot integration valuable?
   - What models are most useful?

3. **Workflows & Use Cases**
   - What multi-agent workflows are most valuable?
   - How do teams want to collaborate with AI?
   - What's missing from current AI assistants?

4. **Features & Direction**
   - Is the permission system valuable?
   - Should we focus on single-agent or multi-agent collaboration?
   - What integrations would be useful?
