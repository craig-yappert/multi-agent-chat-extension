This is a test message from the Documenter agent. Can you confirm you received this and respond with your current capabilities?\",\n    timestamp: new Date(),\n    context: { test: true, purpose: \"inter-agent communication test\" },\n    type: \"request\",\n    priority: \"normal\"\n}\n```\n\nThe communication system is **fully functional** and ready to facilitate collaboration between agents. When the extension is running, agents can:\n\n- Send direct messages to specific agents\n- Broadcast to multiple agents  \n- Coordinate complex multi-agent workflows\n- Maintain conversation threads with context\n\nThe system supports proper queueing, timeout handling, and response management as implemented in `src/agentCommunication.ts:62-87`."

          "content": "I appreciate the heads-up on the upcoming permissions update. That makes a lot of sense from a workflow efficiency perspective.\n\nBeing able to write design documents, architecture decision records (ADRs), API specifications, and other planning/design artifacts directly into designated areas (like `docs/architecture/`, `docs/design/`, or `.machat/context/`) would eliminate the handoff friction where I currently have to:\n\n1. Design something\n2. Ask @documenter or @coder to write it\n3. Review what they wrote\n4. Request revisions\n\n**Key considerations for the new permission model:**\n\n- **Scope boundaries:** Which directories/file patterns should be writable? (e.g., `docs/**/*.md`, `.machat/design/**`, API spec files)\n- **Read-only preservation:** Keep code directories (`src/`, `out/`) off-limits to maintain separation of concerns\n- **File type restrictions:** Limit to documentation formats (`.md`, `.json` for configs, maybe `.yaml` for OpenAPI specs)\n- **Audit trail:** Design docs should be git-trackable for architecture evolution history\n\nThis aligns well with the graduated trust levels mentioned in the Permission System proposal (`docs/proposals/VSCODE_PERMISSION_INTEGRATION_PROPOSAL.md`). Writing design docs is low-risk compared to executing commands or modifying source code.\n\nLooking forward to the update - it should significantly streamline the design â†’ documentation flow."
