This is a test message from the Documenter agent. Can you confirm you received this and respond with your current capabilities?\",\n    timestamp: new Date(),\n    context: { test: true, purpose: \"inter-agent communication test\" },\n    type: \"request\",\n    priority: \"normal\"\n}\n```\n\nThe communication system is **fully functional** and ready to facilitate collaboration between agents. When the extension is running, agents can:\n\n- Send direct messages to specific agents\n- Broadcast to multiple agents  \n- Coordinate complex multi-agent workflows\n- Maintain conversation threads with context\n\nThe system supports proper queueing, timeout handling, and response management as implemented in `src/agentCommunication.ts:62-87`."

Each agent that responds tends to mention additional agents, which then respond and mention more agents, creating a chain reaction.\n\n**What You're Seeing:**\n- Messages appearing in logs but not UI (likely hitting limits or timing issues)\n- Secondary/tertiary spawns as the conversation branches\n- Longer processing times due to multiple parallel agent threads\n\n**Root Causes (likely):**\n1. No mention deduplication - agents can be re-invoked in same thread\n2. No depth limiting - chains can go arbitrarily deep\n3. Agents being too collaborative - mentioning others unnecessarily\n\n**Standing By:**\nI'll wait for you to implement fixes. When you're ready to test again, I'm here!\n\nGood catch on the logs vs UI discrepancy - that's a key debugging clue. üëç"

Fail Fast & Fail Safely**\n- Validate inputs at system boundaries (API gateways, service entry points)\n- Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures across services\n- Design for graceful degradation when dependencies fail\n\n**2. Error Classification**\n- **Transient errors**: Retry with exponential backoff (network timeouts, temporary unavailability)\n- **Permanent errors**: Don't retry (404s, authentication failures, validation errors)\n- **Fatal errors**: Trigger alerts and potential service restarts\n\n**3. Distributed Systems Patterns**\n- Implement timeouts at every network boundary\n- Use bulkheads to isolate failures (don't let one component bring down the system)\n- Design idempotent operations so retries don't cause corruption\n- Use dead letter queues for failed async operations\n\n**4. Observability**\n- Centralized error logging with correlation IDs across services\n- Structured error responses with error codes, not just HTTP status\n- Monitor error rates as key health metrics\n- Include context (user ID, request ID, timestamp) in all error logs\n\n**5. API Design**\n- Consistent error response schema across all endpoints\n- Meaningful error codes and messages for client developers\n- Don't expose internal stack traces to external clients\n- Version your error response format\n\n**6. Data Integrity**\n- Use transactions where atomicity is required\n- Implement compensating transactions for distributed operations (Saga pattern)\n- Have rollback strategies for failed deployments\n\nThe key is **designing systems that expect failure** rather than hoping for success.\n\nüíª **Coder** (broadcast):\nClaude configuration file at C:\\Users\\cyapp\\.claude.json is corrupted: Unexpected end of JSON input\n\nClaude configuration file at C:\\Users\\cyapp\\.claude.json is corrupted\nThe corrupted file has been backed up to: C:\\Users\\cyapp\\.claude.json.corrupted.1759193347847\nA backup file exists at: C:\\Users\\cyapp\\.claude.json.backup\nYou can manually restore it by running: cp \"C:\\Users\\cyapp\\.claude.json.backup\" \"C:\\Users\\cyapp\\.claude.json\"\n\nFrom my implementation perspective, here are key error handling best practices:\n\n## Core Principles\n\n**Fail Fast, Fail Clearly**\n- Validate inputs immediately at function boundaries\n- Throw specific error types (TypeError, ValidationError, etc.)\n- Include actionable error messages with context\n\n**Error Boundaries**\n```typescript\n// Bad\nfunction process(data: any) {\n  const result = data.items.map(x => x.value); // crashes on null\n}\n\n// Good\nfunction process(data: DataType): Result {\n  if (!data?.items) {\n    throw new ValidationError('Missing required items array');\n  }\n  return data.items.map(x => x.value);\n}\n```\n\n**Structured Error Handling**\n- Use custom error classes for domain-specific failures\n- Preserve error chains with `{ cause: originalError }`\n- Log errors with sufficient context before re-throwing\n\n**Async Error Patterns**\n```typescript\n// Promises: Always handle rejections\nawait fetchData().catch(err => {\n  logger.error('Fetch failed', { url, err });\n  throw new DataFetchError('Unable to load data', { cause: err });\n});\n\n// Never swallow errors silently\n```\n\n**Recovery Strategies**\n- Retry with exponential backoff for transient failures\n- Circuit breakers for external dependencies\n- Graceful degradation when possible\n- Clean up resources in `finally` blocks\n\n**Performance Considerations**\n- Avoid throwing errors in hot paths (use Result types)\n- Pre-validate expensive operations\n- Cache validation results when applicable\n\n**What NOT to Do**\n- Don't catch without rethrowing or logging\n- Don't use errors for control flow\n- Don't expose stack traces to users\n- Don't make error handling more complex than the happy path\n\nüîç **Reviewer** (broadcast):\nError: Error: Timeout waiting for response to message msg_1759193344758_gbvpb1px6\n\nüìù **Documenter** (broadcast):\nError: Error: Timeout waiting for response to message msg_1759193344759_privyh1xl"
