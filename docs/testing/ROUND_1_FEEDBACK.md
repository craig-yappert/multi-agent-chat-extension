# Round 1 Testing Feedback - Permission Adjustments Needed

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Phase:** Initial testing before batch updates
**Status:** Collecting feedback

---

## Testing Progress

- [x] 🏗️ **Architect** - Tested, updated, re-test pending
- [ ] 💻 **Coder** - Pending
- [ ] ⚡ **Executor** - Pending
- [ ] 🔍 **Reviewer** - Pending
- [ ] 📝 **Documenter** - Pending
- [ ] 🤝 **Coordinator** - Pending
- [ ] 👥 **Team** - Pending

## 🏗️ Architect Feedback (COMPLETED)

### Test Results
- ✅ Prompt 1 (read files): Success - analysis complete
- ⚠️ Prompt 2 (create ARCHITECTURE.md): Said no, recommended alternative
- ✅ Prompt 3 (npm build): Denied, auto-redirected to Executor
- ✅ Prompt 4 (git history): Denied, auto-redirected to Executor

### Issues Found
1. **Wrong delegation target** - Delegated to @executor instead of @documenter for ARCHITECTURE.md
2. **Missing capability** - Architect should be able to create architecture documentation

### Proposed Changes
✅ **IMPLEMENTED:**
- Add `file_write` to allowed operations
- Add `allowedWritePaths`: `["docs/architecture/", "docs/design/", "ARCHITECTURE.md", "ADR*.md", "DESIGN*.md", "docs/decisions/"]`
- Keep code writing forbidden

### Notes
- Auto-redirect feature working well (inter-agent communication)
- Agent polite about refusals
- Good awareness of constraints

## Summary of Changes Needed

### Permission Updates

**Agent: [Agent Name]**
- [ ] Change 1
- [ ] Change 2

**Agent: [Agent Name]**
- [ ] Change 1
- [ ] Change 2

### System Prompt Updates

- [ ] Add delegation decision matrix
- [ ] Clarify when to delegate vs refuse
- [ ] Add examples of correct agent selection

### Test Updates

- [ ] Update test expectations for changed permissions
- [ ] Add new test cases discovered during testing

---

## Batch Update Plan

**After all feedback collected:**

1. **Review conflicts** - Ensure no overlapping permissions
2. **Update `defaults/agents.json`** - All permission changes at once
3. **Update system prompts** (if needed) - In `providers.ts`
4. **Update test files** - Reflect new expected behaviors
5. **Compile and rebuild** - Single VSIX build
6. **Re-test all agents** - Verify changes work

## Notes & Observations

### General Patterns


### Edge Cases Discovered


### Questions for Phase 2


---

## Testing Tips (Reminders)

- ✅ Use prompt-only files for blind testing
- ✅ Document exact agent responses
- ✅ Note if agent auto-redirected vs just suggested
- ✅ Check if files were actually created/modified
- ✅ Look for helpful vs confusing error messages

**Next:** Test remaining 6 agents and fill in feedback above ☝️
