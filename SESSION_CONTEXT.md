# Session Context - Multi Agent Chat Extension

## Current Version: 1.8.0+ (Latest Development)

## Previous Session Summary (2025-09-17)

Successfully restored functionality after system reset, unified all agents under Claude Sonnet backend, and implemented inter-agent communication framework with performance optimizations.

## Current Session Accomplishments (2025-09-18)

### Critical Bug Fixes & Features

1. **Agent Tag Persistence** ‚úÖ
   - Agent metadata (name, icon, color) now properly saves with each message
   - Tags correctly reload when viewing conversation history
   - Extended ConversationData interface to include agent field
   - Fixed "ASSISTANT" fallback issue on reload

2. **Agent Memory System** ‚úÖ
   - Implemented per-agent conversation context
   - Each agent maintains last 10 exchanges (20 messages)
   - Context persists across session saves/loads
   - Added backward compatibility via `_rebuildAgentContextFromHistory()`
   - Context included in prompts for coherent multi-turn conversations

3. **File Operations Support** ‚úÖ
   - Executor agent can now create/write files
   - Automatic file creation from agent responses
   - Pattern matching for "Creating file:" and code blocks
   - VS Code API integration for safe file operations

4. **Conversation Management** ‚úÖ
   - Added "Clear All Conversation History" command
   - Clears workspace state and all saved files
   - Fresh start capability for clean testing
   - Command available via Ctrl+Shift+P palette

## Technical Architecture Updates

### Key Changes Made

#### extension.ts
- Added `_agentConversationContext` Map for agent memory
- Implemented `_handleFileOperations()` for Executor agent
- Added `_clearAllConversations()` command
- Extended conversation save/load with agent context
- Added `_rebuildAgentContextFromHistory()` for backward compatibility

#### providers.ts
- Enhanced message building with conversation history
- Added context parameter support
- Special handling for Executor agent file operations
- Truncated history in prompts to manage token usage

#### Data Structures
```typescript
interface ConversationData {
  sessionId: string;
  startTime: string | undefined;
  endTime: string;
  messageCount: number;
  totalCost: number;
  totalTokens: { input: number; output: number };
  messages: Array<{
    timestamp: string,
    messageType: string,
    data: any,
    agent?: any  // NEW
  }>;
  filename: string;
  agentContext?: Record<string, any[]>;  // NEW
}
```

### Agents (7 Total) - Enhanced

1. **Architect** (üèóÔ∏è #4A90E2) - System design & architecture
2. **Coder** (üíª #50C878) - Implementation & development
3. **Executor** (‚ö° #FF6B35) - File operations & commands *[ENHANCED with file creation]*
4. **Reviewer** (üîç #9B59B6) - Code review & QA
5. **Documenter** (üìù #F39C12) - Documentation & communication
6. **Coordinator** (ü§ù #E67E22) - Multi-agent orchestration
7. **Team** (üë• #8E44AD) - Full team collaboration

All agents now have:
- Conversation memory (last 10 exchanges)
- Persistent context across sessions
- Proper identity preservation

### Key Files Modified

- `src/extension.ts` - Major updates for memory and file operations
- `src/providers.ts` - Context handling in message prompts
- `package.json` - Added clear conversations command

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Clean Start
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+P
2. Run "Clear All Conversation History"
3. Confirm deletion
```

### 2. Test Agent Memory
- Start conversation with any agent
- Ask follow-up questions referencing previous answers
- Switch agents and verify context isolation
- Reload VS Code and verify memory persists

### 3. Test File Operations
- Select Executor agent
- Ask: "Create a test file called hello.txt with 'Hello World' content"
- Verify file appears in workspace

### 4. Test Agent Tags
- Have conversations with different agents
- Close and reload the extension
- Verify agent names/icons display correctly (not "ASSISTANT")

## Known Issues Resolved

1. ‚úÖ Agent tags reverting to "ASSISTANT" on reload
2. ‚úÖ No agent memory/context between messages
3. ‚úÖ Agent file operations not working
4. ‚úÖ No way to clear old conversations

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. Test inter-agent communication framework
2. Enhance settings UI
3. Improve streaming response updates
4. Code cleanup (remove old Claude Chat remnants)

### Medium Priority
5. Agent specialization refinement
6. Custom agent creation UI
7. Long-term memory implementation
8. Project-specific memory isolation

### Future Enhancements
9. Error recovery improvements
10. Token usage analytics
11. Real-time agent dashboard (complex - approach carefully)

## Git Status

- Branch: `working-stable`
- Major changes to extension.ts and providers.ts
- New features fully compiled and tested
- Ready for comprehensive testing phase

## Environment

- Platform: Windows (win32)
- VS Code extension development
- TypeScript with strict compilation
- Claude CLI integration via child_process spawn

## Important Notes

### Agent Context Management
- Context limited to 20 messages (10 exchanges) per agent
- Automatically truncates older messages
- Saves with conversation for persistence
- Isolated per agent to prevent context bleeding

### File Operations Safety
- Only Executor agent can trigger file operations
- Pattern matching requires explicit "Creating file:" mentions
- Files created in workspace root by default
- User gets VS Code notification for each file created

## Commands for Development

```bash
# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Watch mode
npm run watch

# Package extension
npx vsce package

# Test in VS Code
Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
```

## Next Session Focus

1. **Thorough Testing Phase**
   - Test all new features with multiple scenarios
   - Verify agent memory across complex workflows
   - Stress test file operations
   - Validate conversation persistence

2. **Inter-Agent Communication**
   - Test existing framework in agentCommunication.ts
   - Add visual indicators for agent collaboration
   - Implement message routing between agents

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Check memory usage with large conversations
   - Monitor response times with context included
   - Optimize if needed

## Recovery Information

- All conversation history can be cleared via command
- Agent context rebuilds from history if needed
- File operations are logged to console
- Extension state fully recoverable

## Critical Implementation Details

### Agent Memory Flow
```
User Message ‚Üí Agent ‚Üí Response
