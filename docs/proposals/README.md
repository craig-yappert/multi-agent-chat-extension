## Active Proposals

### üî• High Priority

#### [Claude Code Parity Features](CLAUDE_CODE_PARITY_FEATURES.md)
**Status:** Planned for v1.15.0+
**Complexity:** High

Proposes three major features to match Claude Code's developer experience:
1. **Real-time Diff Viewer** - Preview file changes before accepting
2. **Checkpoint System** - Save snapshots and rollback changes
3. **Workflow Hooks** - Automation triggers for common patterns

**Next Steps:** Break into phases, implement diff viewer first

### ‚öñÔ∏è Medium Priority

#### [Agent Permissions Redesign](AGENT_PERMISSIONS_PROPOSAL.md)
**Status:** Planned for v1.16.0+
**Complexity:** Medium

Proposes trust-with-verification permission model:
- Domain-based default permissions
- Rollback capability instead of prevention
- Reduces permission friction while maintaining safety

**Dependencies:** Should follow diff viewer implementation

### üåü Low Priority

#### [Dynamic Model Discovery](DYNAMIC_MODEL_DISCOVERY_PROPOSAL.md)
**Status:** Future enhancement
**Complexity:** Medium

Proposes auto-discovery of available AI models:
- Query providers for available models
- Dynamic model selection UI
- Reduce manual model configuration

**Note:** Deferred until core features are stable. AI model landscape is too volatile for this to be high value currently.
