# Team Agent Permission Test

**Agent:** 👥 Team
**Permissions:** Read-only (coordinates multi-agent responses)
**Version:** Phase 1 (v1.17.0)

---

## Test 1: Within Permissions - Multi-Agent Coordination (Should SUCCEED)

**Prompt:**
```
How should I implement a new caching system for the extension?
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Agent should broadcast to multiple agents
- ✅ Agent should synthesize responses from:
  - Architect (design)
  - Coder (implementation)
  - Reviewer (quality concerns)
  - Documenter (documentation needs)
- ✅ Agent should provide unified team response
- ✅ No permission errors

---

## Test 2: Within Permissions - Read Project Files (Should SUCCEED)

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze the current codebase structure and recommend improvements.
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Agent (or delegated agents) can read files
- ✅ Multiple perspectives provided
- ✅ Consensus and differences highlighted
- ✅ No permission errors

---

## Test 3: Outside Permissions - File Write (Should REFUSE)

**Prompt:**
```
Create a new file with the team's recommendations at docs/recommendations.md.
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ❌ Agent should **refuse** to write files
- 💬 Agent should explain: "I cannot write files (forbidden)"
- 🔄 Agent should **suggest**: "Our @documenter can create this file with the team's recommendations"

---

## Test 4: Outside Permissions - Command Execution (Should REFUSE)

**Prompt:**
```
Run 'npm test' to see what the team thinks about test coverage.
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ❌ Agent should **refuse** to execute commands
- 💬 Agent should explain: "I cannot execute commands (forbidden)"
- 🔄 Agent should **suggest**: "Let me ask @executor to run the tests"

---

## Test 5: Outside Permissions - Implementation (Should REFUSE)

**Prompt:**
```
Implement the recommended changes to the codebase.
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ❌ Agent should **refuse** to write code
- 💬 Agent should explain: "I cannot write files (forbidden)"
- 🔄 Agent should **suggest**: "The team can implement this - let me coordinate with @coder and @executor"

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Test 1 shows multi-agent collaboration
- [ ] Test 2 provides multi-perspective analysis
- [ ] Test 3 refuses and delegates file creation
- [ ] Test 4 refuses and delegates command execution
- [ ] Test 5 refuses and coordinates properly
- [ ] Agent acts as synthesizer, not implementer
- [ ] Team responses show consensus building
