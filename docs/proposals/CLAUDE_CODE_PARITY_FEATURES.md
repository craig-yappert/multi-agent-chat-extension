# Claude Code Parity Features Proposal

**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2025-09-29
**Author:** Analysis of Claude Code vs Multi Agent Chat Extension
**Priority:** High

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines three critical features from the latest Claude Code VS Code extension (September 2025 release) that should be implemented in Multi Agent Chat to achieve feature parity and enhance user confidence in agent-driven development.

**Current Gap:** Multi Agent Chat provides specialized agent collaboration but lacks the visual feedback, safety mechanisms, and workflow automation that Claude Code now offers natively.

**Goal:** Implement real-time diff viewing, checkpoint/rollback system, and workflow hooks to transform Multi Agent Chat from a conversational AI tool into a full-featured autonomous development assistant.

---

## Feature 1: Real-time Inline Diff Viewer

### Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Agents respond with text-based code suggestions
- Users must manually copy/paste or trust agent file modifications
- No preview of changes before they're applied
- Difficult to understand impact of proposed changes

**User Pain Points:**
- "What files will this change?"
- "Can I see the diff before applying?"
- "I can't trust the agent without seeing what it's doing"

### Proposed Solution

#### Visual Diff Panel
Implement a dedicated VS Code panel that shows:
- **Real-time file change preview** as agents propose modifications
- **Side-by-side diff view** integrated with VS Code's native diff viewer
- **Inline diff annotations** showing additions/deletions
- **Multiple file changes** grouped by agent action

#### Architecture

```typescript
// New component: DiffPanelManager
interface ProposedChange {
  filePath: string;
  originalContent: string;
  proposedContent: string;
  agentId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'applied';
}

class DiffPanelManager {
  // Show diff in VS Code native viewer
  async showDiff(change: ProposedChange): Promise<void>

  // Queue multiple changes from agent
  async queueChanges(changes: ProposedChange[]): Promise<void>

  // User approval workflow
  async approveChange(changeId: string): Promise<void>
  async rejectChange(changeId: string): Promise<void>
  async applyAll(): Promise<void>
}
```

#### Integration Points

1. **Agent Message Parser** - Detect code blocks and file operations
2. **Provider System** - Intercept file write operations
3. **WebView UI** - Add "View Diff" buttons to agent responses
4. **VS Code API** - Use `vscode.diff` command for native viewer

#### User Experience Flow

```
User: "@coder Refactor the authentication module for better security"
↓
Coder Agent: "I'll refactor the auth module..."
↓
[View Changes] button appears in chat
↓
User clicks → Side-by-side diff opens in VS Code
↓
User reviews changes: [Approve] [Reject] [Approve All]
↓
Changes applied to files
```

### Technical Implementation

**Phase 1: Basic Diff Viewer (Week 1-2)**
- Parse agent responses for file operations
- Create temporary file copies for comparison
- Launch VS Code diff viewer

**Phase 2: Approval Workflow (Week 3)**
- Add approve/reject UI controls
- Implement change queueing system
- Track change status

**Phase 3: Multi-file Changes (Week 4)**
- Group related changes by task
- Show change summary panel
- Batch approval/rejection

### Success Metrics
- 90%+ of users preview changes before applying
- <5% of approved changes are reverted
- User confidence scores increase by 40%+

### Dependencies
- VS Code API knowledge
- File system watchers
- Temporary file management

---

## Feature 2: Checkpoints & State Management

### Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- No automatic backup before agent modifications
- Users can't easily revert agent changes
- Fear of "breaking things" limits agent usage
- Manual git commits required for safety

**User Pain Points:**
- "What if the agent breaks my code?"
- "I can't undo what it just did"
- "I'm afraid to let agents make changes"

### Proposed Solution

#### Automatic Checkpoints
Create a lightweight checkpoint system that:
- **Auto-saves code state** before each agent modification
- **Tracks change chains** to understand what changed when
- **Enables instant rollback** to any previous checkpoint
- **Works independently of git** (supplements, doesn't replace)

#### Architecture

```typescript
interface Checkpoint {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  agentId: string;
  description: string;
  fileSnapshots: Map<string, string>; // path -> content
  conversationContext: string;
  userMessage: string;
  parentCheckpointId?: string;
}

class CheckpointManager {
  // Create checkpoint before agent action
  async createCheckpoint(
    agentId: string,
    description: string,
    affectedFiles: string[]
  ): Promise<string>

  // Restore to checkpoint
  async restoreCheckpoint(checkpointId: string): Promise<void>

  // Browse checkpoint history
  async getCheckpointHistory(): Promise<Checkpoint[]>

  // Compare checkpoints
  async diffCheckpoints(fromId: string, toId: string): Promise<FileDiff[]>

  // Cleanup old checkpoints
  async pruneCheckpoints(olderThan: Date): Promise<void>
}
```

#### Storage Strategy

**Option A: Project-local Storage (.machat/checkpoints/)**
- Pros: Per-project isolation, easy cleanup
- Cons: Not version controlled by default

**Option B: Git Stash Integration**
- Pros: Uses existing git infrastructure
- Cons: Requires git repo, clutters stash

**Recommendation:** Project-local storage with optional git commit flag

#### User Experience Flow

```
User: "@coder Implement OAuth2 authentication"
↓
[Checkpoint created: "Before OAuth2 implementation"]
↓
Coder makes changes to 5 files
↓
User tests → Something breaks
↓
User: "Revert to checkpoint"
↓
[Checkpoint restored: All 5 files reverted]
↓
System: "Restored to state from 5 minutes ago"
```

#### Checkpoint UI

**Command Palette Commands:**
- `Multi Agent Chat: View Checkpoints` - Browse history
- `Multi Agent Chat: Restore Checkpoint` - Pick from list
- `Multi Agent Chat: Compare Checkpoints` - See what changed

**Chat Interface:**
- Show checkpoint creation confirmation
- Add "Revert this change" button after each agent action
- Display checkpoint timeline in sidebar

### Technical Implementation

**Phase 1: Basic Checkpoint System (Week 1-2)**
- File snapshot storage
- Pre-modification checkpoint creation
- Simple restore functionality

**Phase 2: Checkpoint Browser (Week 3)**
- UI for browsing checkpoint history
- Diff viewer between checkpoints
- Selective file restoration

**Phase 3: Smart Checkpoints (Week 4)**
- Automatic pruning of old checkpoints
- Checkpoint compression
- Checkpoint descriptions from agent context

**Phase 4: Git Integration (Optional)**
- Auto-commit checkpoints to git
- Tag checkpoints with agent metadata
- Integration with git history

### Success Metrics
- Checkpoint created before 100% of agent file modifications
- 30%+ of users use restore at least once
- User confidence in agent autonomy increases by 50%+

### Storage Considerations
- Keep last 50 checkpoints per project (configurable)
- Auto-prune checkpoints older than 7 days (configurable)
- Estimate: ~5MB per checkpoint for typical project

## Feature 3: Hooks System

### Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- No automated workflow integration
- Manual testing after agent changes
- No pre-commit validation
- Agents don't integrate with existing dev workflow

**User Pain Points:**
- "I have to manually run tests after every change"
- "Agents don't lint their code"
- "I want builds to run automatically"
- "Can't integrate agents with my CI/CD workflow"

### Proposed Solution

#### Workflow Hooks
Implement a flexible hook system that triggers actions at key points:

**Hook Types:**
- `before-change` - Before agent modifies files (e.g., backup, lint check)
- `after-change` - After agent modifies files (e.g., format, test)
- `before-commit` - Before committing changes (e.g., lint, build)
- `after-response` - After agent responds (e.g., log, analyze)
- `on-error` - When agent encounters error (e.g., notify, fallback)

#### Architecture

```typescript
interface Hook {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: HookType;
  command: string;
  args: string[];
  enabled: boolean;
  agentIds?: string[]; // Specific agents or all
  filePatterns?: string[]; // Trigger only for certain files
  conditions?: HookCondition[];
}

type HookType =
  | 'before-change'
  | 'after-change'
  | 'before-commit'
  | 'after-response'
  | 'on-error';

interface HookResult {
  success: boolean;
  output: string;
  duration: number;
  shouldProceed: boolean; // Can block operation
}

class HookManager {
  // Execute hooks at trigger point
  async executeHooks(
    hookType: HookType,
    context: HookContext
  ): Promise<HookResult[]>

  // Register new hook
  async registerHook(hook: Hook): Promise<void>

  // Enable/disable hooks
  async toggleHook(hookId: string, enabled: boolean): Promise<void>

  // Hook library (presets)
  getPopularHooks(): Hook[]
}
```

#### Configuration

**Project Settings (.machat/hooks.json):**
```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "name": "Run Tests",
      "type": "after-change",
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["test"],
      "filePatterns": ["src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts"]
    },
    {
      "name": "ESLint",
      "type": "before-commit",
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "lint"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Format Code",
      "type": "after-change",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["prettier", "--write", "{files}"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**VS Code Settings:**
```typescript
"multiAgentChat.hooks.enabled": true,
"multiAgentChat.hooks.showOutput": true,
"multiAgentChat.hooks.blockOnFailure": false,
"multiAgentChat.hooks.timeout": 30000
```

#### User Experience Flow

```
User: "@coder Add input validation to the form"
↓
[Hook: before-change] Runs backup script
↓
Coder modifies files
↓
[Hook: after-change] Runs ESLint → Finds 2 issues
↓
System: "⚠️ Hook 'ESLint' found issues. Run '@coder fix lint errors'?"
↓
[Hook: after-change] Runs tests → All pass ✓
↓
System: "✓ All hooks passed"
```

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Performance Impact**
- Checkpoint creation could slow down agent responses
- **Mitigation:** Async checkpoint creation, only snapshot changed files

**Risk 2: Storage Consumption**
- Checkpoints could consume significant disk space
- **Mitigation:** Auto-pruning, compression, configurable retention

**Risk 3: Hook Failures**
- Hook errors could break agent workflow
- **Mitigation:** Timeout protection, optional blocking, error recovery

### User Experience Risks

**Risk 4: Complexity Overhead**
- Too many features could overwhelm users
- **Mitigation:** Smart defaults, progressive disclosure, optional features

**Risk 5: Breaking Existing Workflows**
- Users may rely on current behavior
- **Mitigation:** All features optional, gradual rollout, migration guide

---

## Success Criteria

### Feature Adoption
- 70%+ of users try diff viewer within first week
- 50%+ of users have at least one checkpoint
- 40%+ of users configure hooks

### User Confidence
- Survey: "I trust agents to modify my code" increases by 50%
- Revert rate decreases by 30%
- Agent action approval rate increases by 25%

### Development Velocity
- Time from agent response to applied change decreases by 40%
- Manual testing tasks decrease by 50%
- Overall feature implementation time decreases by 20%

---

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Alternative 1: Git-Only Solution
**Idea:** Use git stash/commits for all checkpoints
**Rejected:** Requires git repo, clutters history, slow

### Alternative 2: File Watchers Only
**Idea:** Let VS Code track changes automatically
**Rejected:** No agent context, no restoration workflow

### Alternative 3: External Diff Tool
**Idea:** Launch external diff viewer (Beyond Compare, etc.)
**Rejected:** Not integrated, requires additional software

---

## Open Questions

1. **Should checkpoints be git-aware?** Should we detect if a checkpoint spans an existing git commit?

2. **Hook permissions model?** Should hooks require approval like agent file operations, or trust user-configured hooks?

3. **Cross-agent checkpoint sharing?** If Architect creates checkpoint, can Coder restore it?

4. **Diff approval granularity?** Approve entire change, per-file, or per-hunk?

5. **Hook failure handling?** Should we allow agents to see hook output and fix issues?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Stakeholder Review** - Get feedback on proposal
2. **Technical Spike** - Prototype diff viewer (2 days)
3. **Architecture Review** - Validate approach with team
4. **Implementation Plan** - Break into user stories/tasks
5. **Documentation** - Update CLAUDE.md and user guides
6. **User Testing** - Beta test with select users

---

## Conclusion

Implementing these three features will transform Multi Agent Chat from a conversational AI assistant into a production-ready autonomous development tool. The combination of **visual feedback (diffs)**, **safety mechanisms (checkpoints)**, and **workflow integration (hooks)** addresses the core trust and automation gaps that prevent users from fully embracing agent-driven development.

**Estimated Effort:** 8 weeks (1 engineer)
**Risk Level:** Medium
**User Impact:** High
**Recommended Priority:** High - Implement in Q1 2025
