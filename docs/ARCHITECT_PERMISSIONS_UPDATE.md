# Architect Permissions Update (User Feedback)

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Based On:** Initial testing feedback
**Status:** Implemented and rebuilt

---

## User Feedback Summary

After testing the Architect agent with Phase 1 permissions:

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Prompt 1 (read files): Success - analysis complete
- ⚠️ Prompt 2 (create ARCHITECTURE.md): Said no, recommended alternative (not specific)
- ✅ Prompt 3 (npm build): Denied, auto-redirected to Executor
- ✅ Prompt 4 (git history): Denied, auto-redirected to Executor

**Key Observation:**
> "I do think we need to give architects the default ability to create/edit MD files in specific folders/contexts"

**Rationale:**
- Architects should document their architectural decisions
- Documenter role is for user-facing docs (guides, API docs, README)
- Architect creating architecture-specific docs (ARCHITECTURE.md, ADRs) is natural workflow

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Agent Permissions (defaults/agents.json)

**Before:**
```json
{
  "allowedOperations": ["file_read"],
  "trustLevels": {
    "file_read": "automatic",
    "file_write": "forbidden"
  },
  "allowedPaths": ["*"],
  "description": "Architect is read-only - focuses on design and planning"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "allowedOperations": ["file_read", "file_write"],
  "trustLevels": {
    "file_read": "automatic",
    "file_write": "automatic"
  },
  "allowedPaths": ["*"],
  "allowedWritePaths": [
    "docs/architecture/",
    "docs/design/",
    "ARCHITECTURE.md",
    "ADR*.md",
    "DESIGN*.md",
    "docs/decisions/"
  ],
  "description": "Architect can read all files and write architecture documentation"
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added `file_write` to allowed operations
- Set `file_write` trust level to `automatic`
- Added `allowedWritePaths` for architecture-specific documentation
- Can no longer write code, config, or general documentation

---

### 2. Enhanced Permission System

**New Feature:** Separate read vs write paths

**Updated Types:**
```typescript
export interface AgentPermissions {
    allowedPaths: string[];        // For read operations
    allowedWritePaths?: string[];  // For write operations (optional)
}
```

**Path Matching Enhancements:**
- Simple glob: `*.md` matches any .md file
- Prefix glob: `ADR*.md` matches ADR-001.md, ADR-002.md, etc.
- Directory: `docs/architecture/` matches anything in that folder

---

### 3. Updated PermissionEnforcer

**New Logic:**
```typescript
// Check different paths for read vs write
const pathsToCheck = (isWriteOperation && permissions.allowedWritePaths)
    ? permissions.allowedWritePaths  // Use write-specific paths
    : permissions.allowedPaths;       // Use general paths
```

**Enhanced Pattern Matching:**
- Added support for mid-string wildcards (`ADR*.md`)
- Better error messages ("not in allowed write paths" vs "not in allowed paths")

---

### 4. Updated Test Suite

**New Tests for Architect:**

**Test 2 (was refuse, now succeed):**
```
Prompt: Create ARCHITECTURE.md with your analysis.
Expected: ✅ Successfully creates file
```

**Test 2b (new):**
```
Prompt: Create ADR-001-permission-system.md documenting design.
Expected: ✅ Successfully creates ADR file
```

**Test 2c (new - should refuse):**
```
Prompt: Create src/architecture/ArchitectureValidator.ts
Expected: ❌ Refuses (can't write code), suggests @coder
```

---

## What Architect Can Now Do

### ✅ Can Write (Architecture Documentation):
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (root or anywhere)
- `docs/architecture/*` (anything in architecture folder)
- `docs/design/*` (design documents)
- `docs/decisions/*` (decision logs)
- `ADR-001.md`, `ADR-002.md`, etc. (Architecture Decision Records)
- `DESIGN-*.md` (design documents)

### ❌ Cannot Write (Still Forbidden):
- Code files (`*.ts`, `*.js`, `*.tsx`, etc.)
- General documentation (`README.md`, `docs/guides/`, etc.)
- Configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.)
- Any other paths not in `allowedWritePaths`

### ✅ Can Still Do:
- Read all files (unchanged)
- Provide architectural analysis
- Delegate to other agents via @mentions

---

## Workflow Separation

**Clear role boundaries:**

| Task | Agent | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Architect | ✅ Architecture documentation |
| Create `README.md` | Documenter | ✅ User-facing docs |
| Create `docs/api/endpoints.md` | Documenter | ✅ API documentation |
| Create `ADR-001-database.md` | Architect | ✅ Architecture decision |
| Create `src/architecture/validator.ts` | Coder | ✅ Code implementation |

---

## Testing Instructions

### Architect Can Create Architecture Docs:

```bash
# Test 1: Create root-level architecture doc
"Create ARCHITECTURE.md with project overview"
✅ Should succeed

# Test 2: Create ADR
"Create ADR-001-permission-system.md"
✅ Should succeed

# Test 3: Create design doc
"Create docs/design/database-schema.md"
✅ Should succeed
```

### Architect Still Cannot Write Code:

```bash
# Test 4: Try to create TypeScript file
"Create src/architecture/validator.ts"
❌ Should refuse, suggest @coder
```

---

## Files Modified

**Permission System:**
- `src/permissions/types.ts` - Added `allowedWritePaths` field
- `src/permissions/PermissionEnforcer.ts` - Enhanced path checking logic
- `defaults/agents.json` - Updated Architect permissions

**Tests:**
- `docs/testing/agent-permission-tests/architect-test.md` - Updated test expectations
- `docs/testing/agent-permission-tests/architect-prompts.txt` - Added new test prompts

**Build:**
- Recompiled TypeScript ✅
- Rebuilt VSIX package ✅

---

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Re-test Architect** with new permissions:
   - Try creating ARCHITECTURE.md (should work)
   - Try creating ADR-001.md (should work)
   - Try creating src/validator.ts (should fail)

2. **Verify other agents** still work correctly:
   - Documenter can still write general docs
   - Coder can still write code
   - No unintended permission changes

3. **Document final results** in test files

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] Architect can create architecture documentation
- [x] Architect cannot write code or general docs
- [x] Separate read/write paths working correctly
- [x] Pattern matching supports wildcards
- [ ] Re-tested with updated permissions (pending)
- [ ] All agents still respect their boundaries (pending)

**Updated VSIX:** `multi-agent-chat-1.16.1.vsix` (1.64 MB, 176 files)
**Ready for:** Re-testing with Architect's new permissions
