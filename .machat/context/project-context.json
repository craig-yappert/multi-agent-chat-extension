This is a test message from the Documenter agent. Can you confirm you received this and respond with your current capabilities?\",\n    timestamp: new Date(),\n    context: { test: true, purpose: \"inter-agent communication test\" },\n    type: \"request\",\n    priority: \"normal\"\n}\n```\n\nThe communication system is **fully functional** and ready to facilitate collaboration between agents. When the extension is running, agents can:\n\n- Send direct messages to specific agents\n- Broadcast to multiple agents  \n- Coordinate complex multi-agent workflows\n- Maintain conversation threads with context\n\nThe system supports proper queueing, timeout handling, and response management as implemented in `src/agentCommunication.ts:62-87`."

Each agent that responds tends to mention additional agents, which then respond and mention more agents, creating a chain reaction.\n\n**What You're Seeing:**\n- Messages appearing in logs but not UI (likely hitting limits or timing issues)\n- Secondary/tertiary spawns as the conversation branches\n- Longer processing times due to multiple parallel agent threads\n\n**Root Causes (likely):**\n1. No mention deduplication - agents can be re-invoked in same thread\n2. No depth limiting - chains can go arbitrarily deep\n3. Agents being too collaborative - mentioning others unnecessarily\n\n**Standing By:**\nI'll wait for you to implement fixes. When you're ready to test again, I'm here!\n\nGood catch on the logs vs UI discrepancy - that's a key debugging clue. üëç"
