# TODO Next Session - Multi Agent Chat Extension

## Completed Today (2025-09-30) âœ…

### Morning Session: External Resources Refactor! ðŸŽ‰

- **Extracted all webview resources** to external files
- **Eliminated template literal hell** - No more escaping issues!
- **Fixed all JavaScript syntax errors** - Clean, maintainable code
- **Removed MCP legacy code** - Cleaned up initialization

### Afternoon Session: Inter-Agent Communication Polish! ðŸŽ‰

- âœ… **Timestamp Persistence** - Messages preserve original timestamps on reload
- âœ… **Timestamp Formatting** - Show time-of-day for older messages
- âœ… **CSS Overlap Fix** - Timestamps no longer overlap copy button
- âœ… **Duplicate Messages Fixed** - Processing status no longer sends content
- âœ… **Message Display Order** - Acknowledgment â†’ Execution â†’ Summary
- âœ… **Expand/Collapse Fixed** - DOM elements instead of corrupted innerHTML
- âœ… **Empty Acknowledgment** - Shows "Broadcasting..." when only commands
- âœ… **@all Validation** - No more false "Agent 'all' not found" error
- âœ… **Loop Prevention** - Only blocks simple acknowledgments, not requests
- âœ… **Nested Commands** - Responses don't trigger new @mentions
- âœ… **Redundant Summary** - Disabled showInterCommunication default

### Files Created/Modified

- `resources/webview/script.js` - 213KB with all fixes
- `resources/webview/index.html` - 7.29KB HTML template
- `resources/webview/styles.css` - 81KB with timestamp fix
- `src/extension.ts` - Timestamp preservation, onPartialResponse callback
- `src/providers.ts` - Message order fix, isInterAgentResponse flag
- `src/agentCommunication.ts` - Loop prevention, isInterAgentResponse
- `src/agentMessageParser.ts` - @all broadcast priority
- `package.json` - showInterCommunication default = false

## Next Session Priorities (2025-10-01)

### 1. Agent Personality Exploration

**Observation:** Each agent responds with distinct personality/flavor based on role

- Architect: Structured, principles-focused
- Reviewer: Security and quality-focused
- Coder: Practical, code-focused
- Executor: Action-oriented
- Documenter: Detailed, organized

**Potential Work:**

- Document agent personalities in CLAUDE.md or agents.ts
- Consider if personalities should be more or less distinct
- Explore how to guide synthesis vs concatenation in summaries

### 2. Complex Multi-Agent Workflows

Now that basic inter-agent communication is solid, explore:

- [ ] **Hierarchical Coordination** - Coordinator delegates to sub-teams
- [ ] **Iterative Refinement** - Agents review each other's work in rounds
- [ ] **Parallel Workstreams** - Multiple agent conversations happening simultaneously
- [ ] **Context Preservation** - How well does context carry through long conversations?

### 3. Performance & Optimization

- [ ] **Token Usage Tracking** - Monitor costs of multi-agent conversations
- [ ] **Response Time** - Measure and optimize agent communication speed
- [ ] **Message Queue Management** - Analyze queue processing efficiency
- [ ] **Cache Effectiveness** - Review response caching performance

### 4. User Experience Enhancements

- [ ] **Conversation Visualization** - Show agent interaction graph/flow
- [ ] **Progress Indicators** - Better feedback during multi-agent operations
- [ ] **Message Filtering** - Allow collapsing/hiding inter-agent chatter
- [ ] **Quick Actions** - Common multi-agent patterns as one-click commands

### 5. Future Synthesis Feature (Deferred)

When ready to implement true synthesis instead of concatenation:

- Collect all agent responses
- Send to Coordinator with "synthesize these perspectives" prompt
- Display synthesis as final Coordinator message
- Consider: Token cost vs value of synthesis

## Current State

### Working Perfectly âœ…

- Inter-agent communication (@mentions, @all broadcasts)
- Message persistence and reload
- Timestamp display and preservation
- Expand/collapse for long messages
- Loop prevention
- Message display order
- Clean UI without duplicates

### Known Behaviors (Not Bugs)

- Each agent has distinct personality/voice in responses
- Synthesis is future feature (currently disabled to avoid duplication)
- Inter-agent messages are very transparent (by design)

### Settings to Know

```json
{
  "multiAgentChat.agents.enableInterCommunication": true,  // Enable @mentions
  "multiAgentChat.agents.showInterCommunication": false,    // No redundant summary (NEW DEFAULT)
  "multiAgentChat.interAgentComm.maxMessagesPerConversation": 50,
  "multiAgentChat.interAgentComm.maxConcurrent": 3
}
```

## Commands & Testing

### Build & Install

```bash
npm run compile
npx vsce package --no-dependencies
code --install-extension multi-agent-chat-1.13.0.vsix
```

### Test Scenarios

1. **Simple Broadcast**: `@coordinator quick comms check`
2. **Targeted Messages**: `@architect what's your top principle?`
3. **Complex Discussion**: `@coordinator organize discussion on X with A, B, C`
4. **Reload Test**: Send messages, close/reopen chat, verify persistence

## Notes for Next Session

### What Worked Really Well

- Live inter-agent messages are much better than summaries
- Message flow (ack â†’ execution â†’ done) feels natural
- Agent personalities add character without being distracting
- Persistence ensures conversations are complete on reload

### Things to Explore

- How much personality is "right" for agents?
- When is synthesis worth the token cost?
- Can we visualize complex agent interactions?
- What patterns of multi-agent use emerge?
