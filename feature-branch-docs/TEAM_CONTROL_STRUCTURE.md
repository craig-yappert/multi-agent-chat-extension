# Team Control Structure & Feedback Loop

## Credit Optimization Strategy

### Priority Levels
1. **CRITICAL** - Must complete (bug fixes, core features)
2. **HIGH** - Important improvements (performance, UX)
3. **MEDIUM** - Nice to have (refactoring, documentation)
4. **LOW** - Future considerations (experimental features)

### Credit Allocation Rules
- Maximum 2 agents per task unless CRITICAL
- Single agent for research/planning phases
- Parallel execution only for independent tasks
- Review cycles limited to significant changes

## Control Structure

### Decision Framework
```
1. ASSESS REQUEST
   ├── Complexity Analysis
   ├── Credit Estimate
   └── Agent Requirements

2. PLAN EXECUTION
   ├── Task Decomposition
   ├── Agent Assignment
   └── Dependency Mapping

3. EXECUTE WITH CONSTRAINTS
   ├── Single vs Multi-Agent
   ├── Sequential vs Parallel
   └── Checkpoint Reviews

4. FEEDBACK & ADAPT
   ├── Progress Monitoring
   ├── Credit Usage Tracking
   └── Strategy Adjustment
```

## Feedback Loop Implementation

### Real-time Monitoring
- Track credit usage per agent interaction
- Monitor task completion rates
- Measure output quality vs credit spent

### Adaptive Thresholds
```typescript
interface TaskControl {
  maxAgents: number;        // Based on priority
  maxIterations: number;    // Prevent endless loops
  checkpointInterval: number; // Review frequency
  creditBudget: number;     // Max credits per task
}

const controlMatrix = {
  CRITICAL: { maxAgents: 4, maxIterations: 10, checkpointInterval: 2, creditBudget: 100 },
  HIGH:     { maxAgents: 2, maxIterations: 5,  checkpointInterval: 3, creditBudget: 50 },
  MEDIUM:   { maxAgents: 1, maxIterations: 3,  checkpointInterval: 5, creditBudget: 25 },
  LOW:      { maxAgents: 1, maxIterations: 2,  checkpointInterval: 0, creditBudget: 10 }
};
```

## Team Communication Protocol

### Efficient Agent Interaction
1. **Direct Assignment** - Specific agent for known tasks
2. **Broadcast Query** - Team-wide for complex problems
3. **Chain Delegation** - Sequential handoffs for workflows
4. **Parallel Execution** - Independent subtasks only

### Communication Templates
```
// Efficient Single Agent
"@coder implement [specific feature] following existing patterns"

// Controlled Multi-Agent
"@architect design minimal solution, then @coder implement core only"

// Checkpoint Review
"@reviewer quick validation of critical path only"
```

## Decision Matrix

| Request Type | Primary Agent | Support Agents | Credit Budget |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Bug Fix | @executor | @reviewer (if critical) | 15-30 |
| New Feature | @architect → @coder | @reviewer (final) | 40-80 |
| Refactoring | @coder | None | 20-40 |
| Documentation | @documenter | None | 10-20 |
| Architecture | @architect | @team (consensus) | 30-50 |
| Testing | @executor | @reviewer | 25-40 |

## Feedback Metrics

### Tracking Points
- Credits per task completion
- Time to resolution
- Code quality indicators
- Rework frequency
- Agent efficiency ratios

### Optimization Triggers
- If credits > budget: Simplify approach
- If rework > 2: Change strategy
- If time > estimate: Reduce scope
- If quality < threshold: Add review

## Implementation Rules

1. **Start Minimal** - Begin with simplest solution
2. **Iterate Smartly** - Add complexity only if needed
3. **Fail Fast** - Abandon unproductive paths quickly
4. **Learn Patterns** - Reuse successful approaches
5. **Document Wins** - Record efficient solutions

## Team Consensus Mechanism

### Quick Decisions (Low Credit)
- Single agent proposes
- No objections = proceed
- Objection = coordinator decides

### Major Decisions (High Credit)
- Multiple proposals gathered
- Pros/cons analysis
- Majority vote or user escalation

## Credit Conservation Techniques

1. **Batch Operations** - Group related changes
2. **Template Reuse** - Leverage existing patterns
3. **Smart Defaults** - Assume common cases
4. **Early Validation** - Catch issues before implementation
5. **Focused Reviews** - Check critical paths only

## Escape Hatches

- User override: "proceed regardless of credits"
- Emergency mode: Critical fixes bypass limits
- Learning mode: Higher budget for new domains
- Optimization mode: Strict limits for routine tasks
