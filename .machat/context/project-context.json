This is a test message from the Documenter agent. Can you confirm you received this and respond with your current capabilities?\",\n    timestamp: new Date(),\n    context: { test: true, purpose: \"inter-agent communication test\" },\n    type: \"request\",\n    priority: \"normal\"\n}\n```\n\nThe communication system is **fully functional** and ready to facilitate collaboration between agents. When the extension is running, agents can:\n\n- Send direct messages to specific agents\n- Broadcast to multiple agents  \n- Coordinate complex multi-agent workflows\n- Maintain conversation threads with context\n\nThe system supports proper queueing, timeout handling, and response management as implemented in `src/agentCommunication.ts:62-87`."
